# Drawer

Sometimes, `Dialog` does not always satisfy our requirements, let's say you have a massive form, or you need space to display something like `terms & conditions`, `Drawer` has almost identical API with `Dialog`, but it introduces different user experience.

:::tip

Since v-model is natively supported for all components, `visible.sync` has been deprecated, use `v-model="visibilityBinding"` to control the visibility of the current drawer.

:::

:::tip

This component requires the `<client-only></client-only>` wrap when used in SSR (eg: [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/v3)) and SSG (eg: [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/)).

:::

## Basic Usage

Callout a temporary drawer, from multiple direction

:::demo You must set `model-value` for `Drawer` like `Dialog` does to control the visibility of `Drawer` itself, it's `boolean` type. `Drawer` has three parts: `title` & `body` & `footer`, the `title` is a named slot, you can also set the title through attribute named `title`, default to an empty string, the `body` part is the main area of `Drawer`, which contains user defined content. When opening, `Drawer` expand itself from the **right corner to left** which size is **30%** of the browser window by default. You can change that default behavior by setting `direction` and `size` attribute. This show case also demonstrated how to use the `before-close` API, check the Attribute section for more detail

:::

## No Title

When you no longer need a title, you can remove it from the drawer.

:::demo Set the `withHeader` attribute to **false**, you can remove the title from drawer, thus your drawer can have more space on screen. If you want to be accessible, make sure to set the `title` attribute.

## Customized Content

Like `Dialog`, `Drawer` can be used to display a multitude of diverse interactions.

:::demo

drawer/customization-content

:::

## Customized Header

The `header` slot can be used to customize the area where the title is displayed. In order to maintain accessibility, use the `title` attribute in addition to using this slot, or use the `titleId` slot property to specify which element should be read out as the drawer title.

:::demo

:::

## Nested Drawer

You can also have multiple layer of `Drawer` just like `Dialog`.

:::demo If you need multiple Drawer in different layer, you must set the `append-to-body` attribute to **true**

drawer/nested-drawer

:::

:::tip

The content inside Drawer should be lazy rendered, which means that the content inside Drawer will not impact the initial render performance, therefore any DOM operation should be performed through `ref` or after `open` event emitted.

:::

:::tip

Drawer provides an API called `destroyOnClose`, which is a flag variable that indicates should destroy the children content inside Drawer after Drawer was closed. You can use this API when you need your `mounted` life cycle to be called every time the Drawer opens.
