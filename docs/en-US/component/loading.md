# Loading

Show animation while loading data.

## Loading inside a container

Displays animation in a container (such as a table) while loading data.

:::demo Element Plus provides two ways to invoke Loading: directive and service. For the custom directive `v-loading`, you just need to bind a `boolean` value to it. By default, the loading mask will append to the element where the directive is used. Adding the `body` modifier makes the mask append to the body element.

## Customization

You can customize loading text, loading spinner and background color.

:::demo Add attribute `element-loading-text` to the element on which `v-loading` is bound, and its value will be displayed under the spinner. Similarly, the `element-loading-spinner / element-loading-svg` and `element-loading-background` attributes are used to set the svg icon, background color value, and loading icon, respectively.

:::warning

Although the `element-loading-spinner / element-loading-svg` attribute supports incoming HTML fragments, it is very dangerous to dynamically render arbitrary HTML on the website, because it is easy to cause [XSS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Please make sure that the content of `element-loading-spinner / element-loading-svg` is trustworthy. **Never** assign user-submitted content to the `element-loading-spinner / element-loading-svg` attribute.

:::

## Full screen loading

Show a full screen animation while loading data.

:::demo When used as a directive, a full screen Loading requires the `fullscreen` modifier, and it will be appended to body. In this case, if you wish to disable scrolling on body, you can add another modifier `lock`. When used as a service, Loading will be full screen by default.

## Service

You can also invoke Loading with a service. Import Loading service:

```ts
import { ElLoading } from 'element-plus'
```

Invoke it:

```ts
ElLoading.service(options)
```

The parameter `options` is the configuration of Loading, and its details can be found in the following table. `LoadingService` returns a Loading instance, and you can close it by invoking its `close` method:

```ts
const loadingInstance = ElLoading.service(options)
nextTick(() => {
  // Loading should be closed asynchronously
  loadingInstance.close()
})
```

Note that in this case the full screen Loading is singleton. If a new full screen Loading is invoked before an existing one is closed, the existing full screen Loading instance will be returned instead of actually creating another Loading instance:

```ts
const loadingInstance1 = ElLoading.service({ fullscreen: true })
const loadingInstance2 = ElLoading.service({ fullscreen: true })
console.log(loadingInstance1 === loadingInstance2) // true
```

Calling the `close` method on any one of them can close this full screen Loading.

If Element Plus is imported entirely, a globally method `$loading` will be registered to `app.config.globalProperties`. You can invoke it like this: `this.$loading(options)`, and it also returns a Loading instance.
