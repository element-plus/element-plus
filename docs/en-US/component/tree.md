# Tree

Display a set of data with hierarchies.

## Basic usage

Basic tree structure.

:::demo

tree/basic

:::

## Selectable

Used for node selection.

:::demo This example also shows how to load node data asynchronously.

tree/selectable

:::

## Custom leaf node in lazy mode

:::demo A node's data is not fetched until it is clicked, so the Tree cannot predict whether a node is a leaf node. That's why a drop-down button is added to each node, and if it is a leaf node, the drop-down button will disappear when clicked. That being said, you can also tell the Tree in advance whether the node is a leaf node, avoiding the render of the drop-down button before a leaf node.

## Lazy loading multiple times ^(2.6.3)

:::demo When lazily loading node data remotely, lazy loading may sometimes fail. In this case, you can call reject to keep the node status as is and allow remote loading to continue.

tree/multiple-times-load

:::

## Disabled checkbox

The checkbox of a node can be set as disabled.

:::demo In the example, 'disabled' property is declared in defaultProps, and some nodes are set as 'disabled:true'. The corresponding checkboxes are disabled and can't be clicked.

tree/disabled

:::

## Default expanded and default checked

Tree nodes can be initially expanded or checked

:::demo Use `default-expanded-keys` and `default-checked-keys` to set initially expanded and initially checked nodes respectively. Note that for them to work, `node-key` is required. Its value is the name of a key in the data object, and the value of that key should be unique across the whole tree.

tree/default-state

:::

## Checking tree nodes

:::demo This example shows how to get and set checked nodes. They both can be done in two approaches: node and key. If you are taking the key approach, `node-key` is required.

tree/checking-tree

:::

## Custom node content

The content of tree nodes can be customized, so you can add icons or buttons as you will

:::demo There are two ways to customize template for tree nodes: `render-content` and scoped slot. Use `render-content` to assign a render function that returns the content of tree nodes. See Vue's documentation for a detailed introduction of render functions. If you prefer scoped slot, you'll have access to `node` and `data` in the scope, standing for the TreeNode object and node data of the current node respectively. Note that the `render-content` demo can't run in JSFiddle because it doesn't support JSX syntax. In a real project, `render-content` will work if relevant dependencies are correctly configured.

tree/customized-node

:::

## Custom node class

The class of tree nodes can be customized

:::demo. Use `props.class` to build class name of nodes.

tree/custom-node-class

:::

## Tree node filtering

Tree nodes can be filtered

:::demo Invoke the `filter` method of the Tree instance to filter tree nodes. Its parameter is the filtering keyword. Note that for it to work, `filter-node-method` is required, and its value is the filtering method.

tree/filtering

:::

## Accordion

Only one node among the same level can be expanded at one time.

:::demo

tree/accordion

:::

## Draggable

You can drag and drop Tree nodes by adding a `draggable` attribute.

:::demo

tree/draggable
